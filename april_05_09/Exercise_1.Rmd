## Comments
The viewership dropped the largest by `r dfViewership[dfViewership$season == 2, 'overall_viewership'] - dfViewership[dfViewership$season == 3, 'overall_viewership']` millions between seasons 2 and season 3. Compared to the first season, the last season have less `r dfViewership[dfViewership$season == 1, 'overall_viewership'] - dfViewership[dfViewership$season == 6, 'overall_viewership']` million viewers on average.
